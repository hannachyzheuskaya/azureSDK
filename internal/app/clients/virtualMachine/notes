}

EVERY vm has one attached OPERATING SYSTEM disk >> (os disk has a preinstalled os, which was selected when the vm was created)
GENERALLY YOU SHOULD ONLY OS INFORMATION ON THE OS DISK, AND STORE ALL APPLICATIONS, AND DATA ON DATA DISK
(however, if cost is a concern, you can use the OS disk instead of creating a data disk)

(*)specifies how the virtual machine should be created
ATTACH => when you are using a specialized disk to create the virtual machine
FROM IMAGE => when you are using an image to create the vm:
     if you are using a platform image >> use the imageReference element
     if you are using a marketplace image >> use the plan element
...
